<p><span class="uppercase">hy</span> did
Lucy
Challoner
start
when she entered her
own kitchen, well
knowing that a visitor
was there, for whose
presence she had
given full permission?</p>

<p>She started, because
when one expects
to see a moon-faced,
shy youth,
with a shock of red
hair, it does give one
rather a shock to be
suddenly confronted
by a tall jovial man
of thirty, wearing a full black beard!</p>

<p>What ought Lucy to have done?
Perhaps she ought to have walked
forward, saying that this was not
the person to whom she had made
her kitchen free, inquiring who he was,
and bidding him go about his business.</p>

<p>But poor Lucy was not a business-like
and self-confident mistress, and
she was so thoroughly disconcerted
and taken aback that, with a single
exclamation of surprise, she beat a hasty
retreat.</p>

<p>Upstairs in the dining-room she considered
the position. She could hear
the voices in the kitchen. It seemed to
her that there was smothered laughter
on the part of the man. She could hear
Jane speak with a defiant angry tone.
Some kitchen utensils were moved
sharply and noisily, as by the hand of
an offended person.</p>

<p>It was very clear that the carpenter
sweetheart had been discarded, and that
this stranger had filled his place so
promptly that Jane had not thought it
worth her while to go through any
ceremony of transferring his privileges.
Of course she had known well enough
that her mistress would be no party to
such a rapidly moving panorama of
courtship. Or was there any genuine
courtship in the matter at all, or was
the form of a professed “engagement”
the mask under which mere promiscuous
acquaintances were encouraged? Who
was this man? Lucy could not but
remember his free laughter and loud
talk on what had evidently been the
evening of his first appearance. Now
when she had unwittingly surprised
him in her kitchen, he neither blenched
nor offered the slightest explanation or
apology. As Lucy sat, reflective, she
heard him laugh again.</p>

<p>However, this evening he did not stay
till the usual hour of nine, but went off
as soon as the spring twilight darkened
into dusk—went off with slamming of
doors, and stamping of feet, and
whistling, as he mounted the area stairs.</p>

<p>Lucy lit her lamp. She resolved not
to summon Jane to her presence, but to
wait till she brought the supper tray.
Perhaps she wished to give Jane an
opportunity to come and offer some
voluntary explanation and apology. Perhaps
she wished to calm her own nerves.
Perhaps—and this is the most probable—she
deferred simply out of dread of a
scene. Lucy had always felt that Jane
was an unknown quantity in the house,
so she had no prevision as to how
the servant would act in any crisis.</p>

<p>The maid moved about the kitchen
noisily. It was evident that supper
was to be served in very good time.
If Lucy was afraid of Jane, Jane
was clearly not going to be afraid
of her.</p>

<p>She came upstairs with a very firm
step, and looked straight at her mistress
as she put down the tray. Lucy’s heart
was beating very fast, but she controlled
her nerves enough to say with a perfectly
even voice—</p>

<p>“Jane, I must ask you for some explanation
about the change of your
weekly visitor, for——”</p>

<p>Jane interrupted her.</p>

<p>“Please, m’m,” she said, “there’s no
need to ask me anything. I’ve come to
give you notice—to bid you suit yourself
before this day month. Ever since I’ve
been here I’ve been thinking I’d like service
in the country—with some lady as
is a lady, and doesn’t come a-poking her
nose into my kitchen when she knows
I’ve got a friend there. I like a lady
as looks after her work at the proper
time, not having to go out of a morning
to earn her bread. It’s not your fault,
m’m, I dessay, but it ain’t pleasant for
a girl.”</p>

<p>In face of this impertinence, Lucy
rallied her spirits and dignity. Cost
what such effort may afterwards, it is
not at such moments that any spirited
woman fails or shrinks.</p>

<p>“Very well, Jane,” she said. “Under
these circumstances, I need ask you
no questions. This spares me a painful
task. But as your senior, even but
by a few years and a little experience,
I trust that you will deeply consider your
ways. You have not treated me well.
That may not matter much now. But
I fear that you are not acting in
a way to secure your own womanly
respectability and happiness. If you
seek a reference from me, I shall have
to tell any inquirer what has happened.”</p>

<p>“Very well, m’m. Please, m’m,
you’ll remember it was me that gave you
notice.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember,” said Lucy. Not
another word was exchanged.</p>

<p>The event gave Lucy a sleepless night,
partly because it had excited her beyond
her ebbing strength, and partly because
she could not help forecasting ways and
means with which to meet this fresh
domestic difficulty.</p>

<p>To live in the same house with somebody
so flatly antagonistic as she felt
Jane intended to be, was a hard trial
for a lonely and over-strained woman.
Lucy realised that Jane was capable
of insolence—that her outburst had
not been a mere fit of temper, but
a revelation of the coarse, cruel nature
seething beneath the dull exterior. It
might not have been wise, but if Lucy
had been a free woman, she would have
paid Jane her wages and let her go at
once, so as to clear the atmosphere.
But Lucy was not a free woman; she had
her engagements to fulfil, her work to do.</p>

<p>She had hoped to take advantage of the
fine weather to take Hugh a little out
of town on Saturday afternoons, thus
giving him fresh air and enjoyment, and
also snatching an opportunity to make
a study or a sketch. But now the four
Saturday afternoons which would pass
over before Jane’s departure were all
the leisure in which to seek a new
supply of domestic help. This “month”
of Jane’s would bring Lucy to the
edge of the summer holidays at the
Institute. Had all gone on right
with Jane, Lucy had meant to get her
decent old charwoman to spend her
nights in the house and give the girl
company and security, while she and
Hugh went down to Deal for two
or three weeks. She had a secret
consciousness that she was “running
down” in a way which needed both the
fresh sea breezes and the strong, calm
presence of Jarvis May’s brave widow.
She had hoped to persuade Miss Latimer
to make one of the party. That lady
herself would have respite from her one
or two little engagements, and she had
not had a seaside holiday for two or
three years. Lucy meant to give the invitation
as a favour to herself, since Miss
Latimer’s presence would ensure her
the more leisure and freedom for sketching.
For in that seaside holiday she
had hoped to lay in a store of sketches—as
many as she could possibly work
up before the darkening days of next
winter would be brightened by Charlie’s
return.</p>

<p>Now all these plans of hers must be
knocked on the head! She tried to be
thankful that if she failed to secure
satisfactory help during the coming
month, then the holidays would at least
give her leisure to do her own housework
for awhile. She had accustomed herself
to remember that, as Jeremy Taylor tells
us, every trial has two handles, or at
least that we have two hands, and that,
when anything happens to our displeasure,
it is the part of a wise and
submissive spirit to handle it on that
side in which we can find some comfort
or use. But it seemed to poor Lucy as
if this “handle” was so slight that it
was ready to break in her trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">{627}</a></span>
grasp. She knew that trials which loom
large in the mists of our own minds are
sometimes wonderfully reduced in magnitude
if we can get them outside ourselves,
and state them in plain terms.
So she tried to rally her courage and
spirits by asking what was this trouble,
after all? She was simply parting from a
servant whom she had never liked, and
who had proved herself to be a girl of
low type.</p>

<p>That was how Lucy resolutely put it,
and then it seemed little enough. She
would not let herself add that she was
already worn out under the awful anxiety
of her husband’s illness, the strain of
the separation, the practical solitude,
the unremitting duties which would
allow of no rest nor recreation. She
left these in her sub-consciousness.
When we know that no hand but ours
is on the helm, we can face anything
except the full realisation that we ourselves
are stunned and reeling in the
storm.</p>

<p>It seemed to Lucy that as she and
Miss Latimer were not to have their
holiday together at the seaside, the
next best thing would be to invite Miss
Latimer to spend her holiday in the little
house with the verandah, so that they
might at least enjoy each other’s
society. Miss Latimer accepted the
invitation eagerly, adding the information
that she had got to leave the house
in which she had been living, as the
family were quitting town.</p>

<p>“Come and stay with me, then, till you
are comfortably suited elsewhere,” Lucy
wrote back in reply. “I wish I could
ask you to stay till Charlie returns. But
it would give you too long a journey to
your pupils.”</p>

<p>Miss Latimer’s answer soon came.</p>

<p>“I gladly accept your invitation in its
new extended form,” she said. “I wish
we could be together in this London
which can make separation so easy. I
should not mind the length of the daily
journey to my pupil, but my income is
too small to bear deduction of a railway
fare.”</p>

<p>Lucy pondered over that letter.
Sometimes when Hugh had gone to
bed, she sat in her parlour, too tired to
work and sick with loneliness. Why
should not Miss Latimer stay with her,
paying what she had paid hitherto, less
the railway fare? She wrote to Miss
Latimer, making this proposal, and saying,
“Why not? Are we not sensible
women?” Miss Latimer came and
talked it over, and decided to accept
the plan; then she and Lucy agreed
that, as in this instance there was a
breathing spell before they were deprived
of household help, they would try what
“advertisement” would do.</p>

<p>So Lucy put a very explicit advertisement
into three daily papers, which had
columns both of “Situations Wanted,”
and “Vacant.” Applicants were to call
“on Saturday afternoons only.” When
the first Saturday came, she gave Hugh
his painting book with which to amuse
himself, took her needlework and sat
expectant.</p>

<p>All that came to the house was
repeated postman’s knocks. Every
post brought circulars—printed, typewritten
or lithographed—from different
registry offices. But not one servant,
suitable or the reverse, put in appearance!</p>

<p>Lucy thought this experience must be
special and peculiar. So she resolved
to repeat the process next week. At
the same time, she thought she had
better take more active measures.
Therefore she began to con the columns
of “Situations Wanted,” determined to
write to every advertiser whose statement
of her capacities and requirements held
out any hope.</p>

<p>Lucy had often carelessly glanced
over these columns in days gone by.
Then it had seemed only as if there
were plenty of people “waiting to be
hired” for every purpose. She had
felt quite sorry to think how much hope
deferred and disappointment must be
involved. But when one came to scan
this newspaper page for an express
purpose, it was wonderful into what a
small number the hopeful cases shrank!
“General Servants” in themselves were
few enough, but even those who were so
described all added “where another is
kept,” or “where boy cleans knives and
boots.” Lucy knew by experience that
it was useless to approach these. There
were “lady-helps” by the score. Some
of these were only prepared to work
“where there is a servant.” The
others specially stated that they would
do “nothing menial.”</p>

<p>There were, however, two advertisers
who described themselves as “useful
helps,” “well educated and highly
recommended,” and who laid down
no conditions save concerning “a
comfortable home” and a “salary” not
higher than the wages Mrs. Challoner
was prepared to give. The one, “Miss
L.,” called herself thirty-two, and gave
an address in a suburb on the northern
edge of London. The other described
herself as twenty-six, and gave her name
as Miss F., Parsonage Cottage, in a little
town not very far away.</p>

<p>To both these addresses Lucy wrote.
She detailed her own position, and added
that she would be anxious to make every
concession to give comfort and leisure to
any well-educated woman whose household
co-operation she could secure. She
particularly requested a prompt reply in
any case, and enclosed stamped and
directed envelopes.</p>

<p>Day after day of the second week
passed. No reply came from either
“Miss L.” or “Miss F.” Presently
Lucy noticed that she received a circular
from a registry office, established in the
country town from which Miss F. had
issued her advertisement. She also discovered
that both “Miss L.” and “Miss
F.,” while apparently ignoring answers
to their advertisements, were still repeating
those advertisements. Also she
found another advertisement word for
word like “Miss L.’s,” but this time requesting
that answers should be directed
to “Miss N.” somewhere in the S.W.
district.</p>

<p>“Surely things are not what they
seem!” thought Lucy. She wrote again,
but much less sanguinely this time, to
the one or two advertisers, whose
case seemed in the least likely to meet
her requirements, and began to wonder
whether her own advertisements would
bring any applicants on the second
Saturday.</p>

<p>But lo! on the Friday afternoon a
prospect of relief opened up from a
wholly unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>Miss Latimer had gone out to tea.</p>

<p>As Lucy and Hugh, on their return
from the Institute and the Kindergarten
turned hand in hand into Pelham Street,
they saw a neat brougham standing in
front of the little house with the
verandah.</p>

<p>Lucy knew at once what guest this
was. The Challoners had only one
“carriage visitor,” and even she was
not a “carriage person” in the strictest
sense. For a month every year, generally
the month of blossoming trees,
picture galleries and distinguished
strangers in London, Mrs. Bray hired a
brougham. As for the rest of the year,
for six months of it she never left her
own house, for two months more she
and Mr. Bray went to Bath or Buxton
or Harrogate, and for the remaining
three she limited herself to hobbling
promenades in the Gardens near her
home, where she could lean on the arm
of her faithful Rachel, or indulge herself
in the dissipation of a chair and a
chairman.</p>

<p>In her “carriage month” the old lady
put herself in step with the latest ideas
in fashion, art, and science, picked up
one or two new acquaintances to fill the
gaps left by death among old friends,
and punctiliously returned every call
which she had received during the
season of her seclusion or limitation.</p>

<p>“Here is Mrs. Bray come to see us,
Hugh,” said Lucy. Whereupon the
boy joyously echoed “Mrs. Bray!” and
set off at a canter. Lucy hastened
her steps after him. But as the child
reached the little house with the
verandah, he did not rush at the door,
or even pull the bell, but turned aside to
the brougham. It was evident that the
object of interest was still in its interior.
Yes, there she was, Mrs. Bray herself,
throwing up her hands in delight on
catching sight of Lucy.</p>

<p>“Oh, how fortunate that we should
appear just as you arrived!” cried Lucy.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting ten minutes, my
dear,” said the old lady. “Your servant
would not let me in; she said ‘the missis
was awful partic’ler, and she’d never
had no words with her, except about lettin’
folks into the house too easy.’”
(Jane’s accent and grammar did not
lose in Mrs. Bray’s imitation.) “What
harm she thought a poor limping, half-blind
old dame is likely to do, I don’t
know. But it is clear that you’re an awful
dragon, my dear. I shouldn’t have
thought it of you.”</p>

<p>Lucy had given Hugh the latch-key
wherewith to open the door, and while
Mrs. Bray spoke, she was making
her way into the hall, aided by Lucy’s
arm.</p>

<p>“This is very annoying,” said Lucy.
“I leave you to imagine under what
circumstances I have been ‘partic’ler’
about ‘folks’ coming into the house.
I fear Jane has done this out of pure
malice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">{628}</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear, I thought so at once,” returned
Mrs. Bray, “and I was a perfect
match for her; for I showed no annoyance,
and I highly commended you, saying
that if all ladies were as prudent we
should not hear of half the robberies
which take place.” Mrs. Bray gave a
quick little nod of triumphant self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>“And, my dear,” she went on, “that’s
not the sort of girl for you to have about
your house. A creature who will turn
her own misdemeanours into nettles to
sting you with, is capable of anything.
She should be at once sent off about her
business.”</p>

<p>“She is going off about it,” answered
Lucy. “The moment she knew she
had done something which I could
not pass over in silence, she gave me
‘notice.’”</p>

<p>“Hoity-toity,” cried Mrs. Bray;
“and I hope you’ve got somebody else,
and will be able to release her before
her date?”</p>

<p>Lucy shook her head with a sad little
smile. “But don’t let me talk kitchen,”
she said, “I want to hear your impressions
of the Royal Academy.”</p>

<p>“It’s been open for just a fortnight,”
said Mrs. Bray, looking keenly at her.
“Of course, you’ve been? I know all
about your bothering Institute classes,
but there was Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Last Saturday I had to stay indoors
in hopes of interviewing servants,” Lucy
answered cheerfully, “and I shall have
to do the same to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“There now, my dear, you see that
kitchen will come into our talk,” returned
Mrs. Bray, shaking a playful finger at
her hostess. “You can’t shut it out.
It underlies all our living, and we ought
to speak about what really concerns and
interests us. It is called underbred to
shrink from ‘talking shop,’ but after all
it is the only talk worth engaging in.
You verify my words, my dear, for you
wanted to turn from the kitchen to pictures,
that being ‘the shop’ you prefer.
But the kitchen comes first, my dear.
At bottom, the pictures depend on the
kitchen. The greatest artists would tell
you so, though they’ve left off glorifying
copper pots and carrots as the good old
Dutch school used to do.”</p>

<p>By this time Lucy had set out her little
afternoon tea-tray, and had summoned
Jane to bring the kettle with boiling
water. Everything else she did herself,
yet she was not too pre-occupied to be
amused by her visitor’s expression while
the handmaid was in the room. It was
the expression of a person unwillingly in
the presence of a noxious animal. What
pained and puzzled Lucy was, that this
and Mrs. Bray’s earlier diatribe seemed
to have had a good effect upon Jane so
far as making her move more softly and
speak more respectfully. It acted as all
her own justice, patience, and consideration
had failed to do.</p>

<p>“A horrid girl,” was the lady’s comment
as Jane departed.</p>

<p>“You see her at her very best,” remarked
Lucy, with a constrained little
laugh. “You seem to have had a good
effect on her. I must have made some
mistake in dealing with her.”</p>

<p>“She sees that I know her at her
exact worth, or rather worthlessness,”
retorted the old lady, “and worthless
people respect one for that at least
as much as the worthy do for one’s just
appreciation. But don’t distress yourself
about your ‘mistakes,’ my dear.
I’m only a visitor, and you are that
hateful thing, a mistress; that gives her
a different point of view. Above all, I
come in a carriage, which, doubtless,
she thinks is my own. My dear, make
up your mind to the fact that to the
common people ‘the real lady, whom it
is a pleasure to serve,’ is the woman
with money—the woman who does nothing,
but expects everybody to wait upon
her and to put her first. In their eyes,
nobody who works for her living is ‘a
real lady.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we need attribute these
things to the ‘common people,’” said
Lucy quietly. “I notice the same feeling
among the mass of women of my
own class.”</p>

<p>Whatever the old lady had originally
meant, she was too keen and alert to
deny the truth of Lucy’s proposition.
She adroitly parried it.</p>

<p>“My dear, the common people form
the mass of every class. There are
more of them in the lower classes simply
because the lower classes are the larger.
Sometimes, too, the others are too
cowardly to put their creed into words,
though they are faithful enough to it in
deeds. But of course I don’t know much
about the young women of our class nowadays.
I thought you had changed all
that, and that all of you were running
after ‘careers.’”</p>

<p>Lucy laughed. “I don’t think that
makes any difference,” she said. “A
very plain distinction is generally drawn
between the young woman who selects
a career for her pleasure and her
‘interest in life,’ and the other who does
the same thing for her livelihood.”</p>

<p>“And I daresay nobody emphasises
that distinction more strongly than some
of your most advanced women,” said
Mrs. Bray, whose searching observation,
despite her professed ignorance, had
probably taught her all that Lucy could
tell her and a good deal more too.
“So that’s the present-day way of it, is
it? Well, my way would be that every
girl should have her own father to give
her a dowry suitable to her position, and
her own husband who would do all the
rest. I suppose that’s Utopia. We all
have Utopias, and that’s mine. What
does a woman want with a career, except
for a living? Her grandmother and her
great-grandmother (if she had any, poor
dear!) found enough career in making
the most of what the gods—I mean the
men—provided.”</p>

<p>“But even girls who don’t need a
livelihood may find it hard to occupy
themselves,” Lucy mildly suggested.
“It seems cruel to deny work to any
human being.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, my love, but it’s very
mean of them to want to be provided
for as women and working women at one
and the same time. Let them be one or
the other, whichever they choose; they’ve
a right to freedom of choice, but they
ought not to be both. Why, to be so
is to be the very worst form of—what is it
Mr. Bray calls the men whom labourers
don’t like?—black caps? No, blacklegs—yes,
the very worst form of blackleg.
It’s not ladylike. But here am I,
rattling away about all sorts of women’s
social questions (which are but branches
from the kitchen after all), and forgetting
the kitchen itself. Do you
know, my dear, the minute you said
that this hussy is leaving, it occurred to
me that I know somebody who can come
in her place, who will probably suit you
to a T, and who will regard me as a
special providence if I get her the
situation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Bray,” cried Lucy, “you
make my heart leap with delight. This
is so unexpected. Surely it is too good
to be true!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="ph3">VISITORS FOR MARION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weather was now getting much warmer,
the days were long and sunny, and the
evenings light until late; so the girls began
to make certain changes in their housekeeping
arrangements. To begin with, the
choral society which they had been attending
on Wednesday evenings all the winter ceased
in April, so they had late dinner every evening
except Saturday and Sunday. There was
some talk of their joining a tennis club; but
both Jane and Ada were generally too tired
to play after their day’s work, and, as the
prudent Marion pointed out, if they joined a
club it would mean that they would rush off
to play directly they came home for as long
as it was light, and get no solid food until
past eight o’clock, when it would be too late
to see about dinner. Jane thought that this
would not matter in the very least, as it would
soon be getting too hot for anyone to think of
eating; but she was over-ruled by her two
elders, who insisted that, as none of them got
a solid meal in the middle of the day, it would
be a fatal thing if the one big meal were
postponed altogether. So she was obliged
to give in and be content with what tennis
she could get at friends’ houses on Saturday
afternoons. This was not very much, and she
had a good long walk to get it; but she
thought it was better than nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">{629}</a></span></p>

<p>Early in May came a short note from Mrs.
Holden to Marion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“May 6th.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Marion</span>,—Are you ever at
liberty to receive visitors, or are you perpetually
busy? Do let me know if I may come
over and see you next Saturday afternoon. I
want to have a talk with you, and I have to
come up to West Hampstead to look over
some houses in your neighbourhood. I have
written to a house agent for some addresses.
Our neighbourhood here is getting so terribly
built over, and it is too low down to suit
Arthur, who suffers occasionally from bronchitis,
so we are thinking of making a move
in your direction, as Hampstead stands high.
I  shall be so glad to be near you, and I hope
you will return the compliment.</p>

<p>“Do not think I intend to worry you to
go house-hunting with me, for I should not
dream of allowing such a thing. Arthur is
too busy to come over with me; but my
brother Tom is home on leave just now. I
forget if you ever saw him—I think he was at
school when you used to stay with us. It
will do him good to have some sensible
domestic occupation such as house-hunting.
So I shall come and have a delightful cosy
chat with you on Saturday if you will have
me, and he shall look over the houses whilst
we are discussing the affairs of the State.
(By the way, why did some scones I made last
week come out of the oven <i>freckled</i>? Don’t
forget to tell me.) Whilst we are discussing
the affairs of the State, Master Tom can look
over the houses and select the most suitable
for me to inspect when you are tired of hearing
me chatter.</p>

<p>
<span class="ml2">“In haste,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">“Yours ever,</span><br />
<span class="ml6">“<span class="smcap">Madge Holden</span>.”</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Marion laughed heartily over this letter, and
read it out to the other two.</p>

<p>“What does she mean?” asked Ada in a
perplexed tone. “How can the scones be
freckled?”</p>

<p>“I have a vague recollection of something
of the sort happening to some of mine once,”
said Jane; “but I have known so many
accidents and failures that I can’t possibly
recollect them all. Oh, I know! How
stupid of me! Of course, the carbonate of
soda and cream of tartar were not properly
mixed into the flour, and so wherever there
was soda a brown patch was the result, as
it always makes things darker when used
alone.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Jennie!” said Marion. “I shall
tell Mrs. Holden that you will write yourself
and reveal the mystery of the scones. I am
sorry you and Ada will not see her and her
brother as you are going to the concert.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen her brother Tom?”
asked Ada.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t remember having done so.
But I heard of a schoolboy escapade of his
years ago. His mother was entertaining
visitors on a dark winter afternoon just at
dusk; they had rung for the gas to be lighted,
but the servant was a long time in coming.
In the meantime they were considerably
startled by a light that kept flashing in at
the window and then disappearing. When
everybody was well startled the cause was
discovered. Master Tom and some boon
companions were at the schoolroom window
above amusing themselves by drawing a
dark lantern up and down. Hence the
phenomenon.”</p>

<p>“How like a boy!” said Jane sedately.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon Mrs. Holden appeared,
resplendent in a bonnet made of
primroses, and with her a tall, sunburnt young
fellow, whom she introduced as her brother,
Tom Scott.</p>

<p>“But you must not stay, you know, Tom,”
said the lively lady. “You really must go
and see about those houses, and we shall only
bore you with our domestic talk.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scott smiled languidly. He was
ensconced in Jane’s own particular rocking-chair
and showed no disposition to move, but
looked appreciatively round the sunny little
sitting-room and at his bright-eyed little
hostess, who sat by the work-table at the
window with a bunch of sweet-smelling spring
flowers in a vase beside her.</p>

<p>“I find this climate so trying after India,”
he remarked.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Tom! Marion, he is too lazy
for anything! How far is it to Thornicroft
Gardens?”</p>

<p>Marion said that it was only two streets
away.</p>

<p>“We must have tennis,” said Mrs. Holden;
“so, if the houses are nice, one of those might
do, as I understand the gardens at the back
have several courts. I am thankful Tom is
an engineer: so if there is anything radically
wrong with the house he will detect it, so I
have not that responsibility! Now, Tom, do
start off; and, if you are good, Marion will
give you some tea when you get back! Be
quick!”</p>

<p>So off he went, and for the next half-hour
Mrs. Holden poured her domestic experiences
into the ear of the sympathetic Marion.</p>

<p>“Tell me about calves’ heads,” she began
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean?” cried Marion,
laughing. “You are like a child asking for a
story. ‘Tell me about fairies.’”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what I mean!” she
said impatiently. “I want to know all about
them, how much they cost, and if it would be
feasible to have one, and if they are nice.
But I won’t have one if the cook is likely to
make a hash of it!” she said energetically.</p>

<p>“Well, your cook might make a hash, and
a very good hash too; but that is no reason
why you should not have one. You need only
have half a head, which will cost you about
3s. or 3s. 6d. Have it boiled the first day and
served with white sauce over and bacon round
alternately with slices of tongue, and hashed
the second day.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you have to skin it, or do
something like that first? I read something
about skinning it in my cookery-book, and it
puzzled me dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“All that is done at the butcher’s. It is
as well to blanch the head by putting it in
boiling water, bringing the water to the boil,
and throwing it away. Then put it in a pan,
with enough water to cover and vegetables to
flavour, and cook gently about two and a half
hours.”</p>

<p>“That was just what I wanted to know. I
understand about skinning the tongue and
cutting it in pieces to put round the dish; but
what are you to do with the brains?”</p>

<p>“Tie them in muslin and cook them for
half an hour separately in water or stock,
divide in small pieces and put round the
dish. Before you go I will give you a nice
recipe for hashing the remains. By the way,
was the dinner list of any use?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Here is this week’s then,” said Marion,
as she went to her desk and, opening it, gave
the list to Mrs. Holden. “You see we have
just been having calf’s head ourselves.”</p>

<p>“By the way, I have made a discovery.
Oh, I know it will be no news to you; but I
was proud of it, I assure you! It is, that
there are several quite cheap pieces of veal
that one can buy—breast of veal, for instance,
and neck—for 8d. a pound. I always had
looked upon veal as quite dear. But I don’t
know how to cook these joints. You can’t
make veal cutlet of them, can you?”</p>

<p>“No; they would not do for that. But the
‘Spring Stew’ that you see there is a dish
made of neck of veal, new potatoes, spring
onions and lettuce.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks. It is of no use trying to
get my people to eat cold meat; they simply
won’t. Tom is so accustomed to the good
cooking of his native servants that he is a
dreadful handful. I am so glad you taught
me how to make a good curry; that at least is
always appreciated.”</p>

<p>“Is he graciously pleased to commend it?”
asked Marion, laughing.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. He has a most extraordinary
opinion of your talents, as he said he did not
know such a thing as a good curry was to be
had in England. Was that not rude? Now,
I will not talk ‘cooking’ any more. Do play
me something. I see the piano is invitingly
open. It is ever so long since I heard you.
Or will it tire you?”</p>

<p>“I am not tired at all,” said Marion, and
went to the piano. “What shall it be?
Something calm and soothing, I suppose, and
not at all suggestive of domestic worries.”</p>

<p>So Marion played a delicious “Lullaby” of
Rubinstein’s, and Mrs. Holden lay back in
the rocking-chair to listen—a graceful figure
in blue.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much!” said a voice behind
her as she finished.</p>

<p>Marion started slightly, and looked round
to find that Mr. Scott had come back again,
and had been let in by Abigail without her
noticing the fact.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holden laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>“I have not had such a treat since I went
to India,” said her brother. “Pray do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">{630}</a></span>
stop. You don’t know how much I enjoy
it,” and he sat down prepared to listen to
more.</p>

<p>So Marion played on. This time it was
the “Spinn lied” from the “Lieder ohne
Worte.”</p>

<p>“Tom, you are positively improving,” said
his sister critically, as she finished and Abigail
came in with the tea-things. “Just before
you went away, I remember taking you to a
Saturday concert at St. James’s Hall, and you
annoyed me by coming out in the middle.
Marion’s playing seems to have worked a sort
of charm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Madge, you must not give
me such a bad character! I am very fond of
music really, Miss Thomas,” he said, turning
to Marion; “but I always prefer it at home.
Somehow, a concert always makes me feel
very sleepy towards the end. I don’t know if
it is the heat, or what.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to mind the heat, surely,”
she suggested, smiling.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, at all events, it is not nearly so
enjoyable.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about the house, Tom?”
asked his sister, as she drank her tea and
ate Marion’s crisp little home-made cakes
appreciatively.</p>

<p>“Green Lawn, in the next street but one,
has just the number of rooms you want.
Everything about it seems all right, and there
is an excellent tennis lawn. Could you move
by Lady Day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must. Did you see no others?”</p>

<p>“What was the good of looking at others
until you had signified that this would not do,”
he remarked sagely.</p>

<p>“Marion, can you come and look at it with
us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” and she went to put on
her hat.</p>

<p>“You need not stay longer if you want to
be off,” said Mrs. Holden to her brother when
Marion had left the room. “We shall manage
quite well by ourselves. I know men don’t
care for fussing about over houses, and you
said you wanted to go down to the club.”</p>

<p>He seemed to think the club could wait, for
he made no haste to be off; and soon Marion
came in again, looking very charming in her
pretty hat with pink primulas.</p>

<p>So the three walked through the sunny
streets to Green Lawn. It did not take very
long to look over the house, and Mrs. Holden
was delighted with it, and quite decided to
take it if her husband liked it as well as she
did.</p>

<p>“So we shall soon be having you for
neighbours, and how delightful that will be,
my dear! I only hope I shall not worry you
by incessantly running in to ask advice. I
really must be self-denying, and not run into
the Rowans too often. Come and have dinner
with me next week and talk it all over.
Which day can you come? Come next
Thursday if you can. You don’t mind coming
so far now the evenings are so light, do you?
Tom can see you home.”</p>

<p>Marion protested that she was quite equal
to seeing herself home; but Mrs. Holden
insisted, and so it was arranged. By this
time they had arrived at the station from
which Marion’s friends were going back to
Camberwell, so they said good-bye.</p>

<p>When she got home, she remembered that
Mrs. Holden had not got the recipe that had
been promised; so she wrote it out at once
and posted it to her lest she should want to
use it before they met next Thursday.</p>

<p><i>Hashed Calf’s Head.</i>—Cut the remains of
a cooked calf’s head into neat pieces. Chop a
large onion and cook it in three tablespoonfuls
of vinegar for ten minutes; add a dessertspoonful
of Chutney and two tablespoonfuls of
flour mixed with a gill of cold stock. Stir
until it boils, stir in a pint of the stock in
which the head was cooked; season well and
colour with browning. Put in the slices of
head, and simmer very gently for half an
hour.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">o</span> many people
get tired of the
ordinary way of
serving fruit
simply stewed
or as a tart, that
I hope the following
collection
of recipes
of different and
dainty ways of
utilising fruit
may be used
to vary somewhat
the monotony
of a wholesome
article of
diet.</p>

<p><i>Apple Pudding.</i>—Six
apples
peeled and
cut up in pieces, one quince, half a teacupful
of water, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, the rind
of half a lemon, one teaspoonful of lemon juice
and a piece of butter the size of an egg. Put
all into an enamelled pan and stew to a soft
pulp and rub through a sieve. If the apples
have been cooked very soft and are free from
lumps, then it is not necessary to put them
through a sieve.</p>

<p>Into the pulp stir three eggs, well beaten,
a quarter of a pound of stale bread or cake
crumbs grated, a dash of nutmeg, and two
tablespoonfuls of milk. Pour into a tin mould
previously well buttered inside and dusted
with crumbs and bake in a good oven for
quite an hour, turn out and serve with fine
sugar over the top.</p>

<p><i>Apple Soufflé.</i>—Butter the outside of a pie-dish
and cover with pastry made as follows—</p>

<p>Six ounces of flour, three ounces of butter,
two teaspoonfuls of sugar, and the yolk of an
egg. Rub butter, sugar, and flour together,
then mix to a paste with the beaten yolk and
a little water. Roll out in the usual way, cut
to the size of your dish, cover, and put into a
good oven to bake, and slip off, and then you
have a dish of paste. Meanwhile peel and
core one and a half pounds of apples, and stew
them with a quarter of a pound of sugar and
juice and grated rind of half a lemon till quite
soft; then stir in half-a-dozen ratafia biscuits
and a penny sponge cake crumbled down, the
yolks of two eggs and a drop of water. Cook
on the fire again for a minute or two, then
pour into the pastry-dish and spread over the
top the whites of the three eggs beaten to a
stiff froth with a tablespoonful of sifted sugar,
dust sugar on the top and ornament with
ratafia biscuits and preserved cherries to taste,
then place in a nearly cold oven to slightly
brown.</p>

<p><i>Apple Fritters.</i>—Make a batter of a pint of
milk, two well-beaten eggs, and flour enough
to make a thick batter. Pare, core, and
chop up into small pieces six apples, mix into
the batter and fry in spoonfuls in boiling lard
deep enough to cover the fritters. Fritters
can also be made by slicing pared and cored
apples, dipping them into thick pancake
batter and frying them in butter.</p>

<p><i>Apple Dumplings.</i>—Six apples pared and
cored, six ounces of dripping, one pound of
flour, one teaspoonful of baking powder, one
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, two ounces
of sugar.</p>

<p>Put flour, powder, and salt in a basin,
rub in the dripping lightly, then make into a
stiff paste with water. Divide into six pieces,
roll out and place an apple on each, fill up
cores with sugar and work paste round each
apple till covered, brush over with milk, place
on a greased tin and bake from half an hour
to three-quarters.</p>

<p><i>Apple Meringue.</i>—Stew six apples pared
and cored till soft, then stir in a small piece
of butter. When cold add a cup of grated
bread-crumbs, the yolks of two eggs, a tip of
salt, sugar to taste, and a small cup of milk.</p>

<p>Butter a dinner plate, cover it with short
crust or puff paste, make a fancy border, and
bake till done. In the middle pour the apple
batter, and heat up. Take the whites of the
eggs, beat stiff with half a teacup of fine sugar
and a few drops of essence of lemon, pile on
the top of apples to cover them, place in oven
to set but not to brown. Sprinkle pink sugar
over the top and serve hot or cold.</p>

<p><i>Apple Pudding</i> (American).—One quart of
milk, four eggs, three cupfuls of chopped
apples, the juice of a lemon and half the
grated rind, nutmeg to taste and a pinch of
cinnamon, one quarter of a teaspoonful of
carbonate of soda dissolved in a little vinegar,
flour enough to make a stiff batter. Beat the
yolks of the eggs very light, add the milk and
seasoning, then the flour; stir hard for five
minutes, then beat in the apples, then the
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth,
and lastly mix the soda well in. Bake in two
square shallow tins, buttered, for one hour.
Cover with a buttered paper when half done
to prevent it hardening. Eaten hot with a
sweet sauce.</p>

<p><i>Apple Meringue Pudding.</i>—One pint of
stewed apples, three eggs (yolks and whites
beaten separately), a half cupful of fine sugar
and one dessertspoonful of butter, one teaspoonful
of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed, one
teaspoonful of lemon juice. Add sugar, spices,
butter and yolks to the apples while hot, pour
into a buttered dish and bake for ten minutes.
Cover while still in the oven with a meringue
made of the stiffly-beaten whites, two tablespoonfuls
of castor sugar and a little almond
essence. Spread it smoothly and quickly,
close the oven again and brown slightly. Eat
cold with cream and sugar.</p>

<p><i>Apple Omelette.</i>—Six apples, one tablespoonful
of butter, nutmeg to taste, and a
teaspoonful of rose-water.</p>

<p>Stew the apples as for sauce, beat them
smooth while hot, adding the butter, sugar
and nutmeg. When perfectly cold put in the
yolks beaten well, then the rose-water, and
lastly the whites whipped stiff; pour into a
warmed and buttered pie-dish. Bake in a
moderate oven till delicately browned.</p>

<p><i>Brown Betty.</i>—One cupful of bread-crumbs,
two cups of sour chopped apples, half a cupful
of sugar, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">{631}</a></span>
tablespoonfuls of butter chopped into small
bits.</p>

<p>Butter a deep pie-dish, put a layer of
apples at the bottom, sprinkle with sugar,
cinnamon and pieces of butter, then crumbs,
then another layer of apples, sugar, and so
on till the dish is full, having crumbs on the
top. Cover closely and bake in a moderate
oven for three-quarters of an hour, then
uncover, sprinkle with a little sugar and
brown quickly.</p>

<p><i>Apple Batter Pudding.</i>—One pint of rich
milk, two cups of flour, four eggs, a teaspoonful
of salt, a quarter of a teaspoonful of soda
dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Peel and core eight apples, and arrange
them closely together in a pie-dish. Beat the
above batter till light and pour it over the
apples and bake for one hour in a good oven.
Unless the apples are very sweet, the cores
should be filled up with sugar.</p>

<p><i>Apples and Tapioca.</i>—One teacupful of
tapioca, six juicy sweet apples, a quart of
water and some salt.</p>

<p>Soak the tapioca in three cups of lukewarm
water in a pan, put the pan back on the range
and let it just keep warm for several hours till
the tapioca becomes a clear jelly. Peel, core,
and pack the apples together in a dish, fill the
centres with sugar, cover and steam in the
oven, then put the tip of salt into the tapioca,
and pour it over the apples, return to the oven
and leave till quite cooked—about an hour.
Serve with cream. If there is any objection
to the appearance of the pudding, then a
beaten white of egg can be spread over it just
before removing from the oven.</p>

<p><i>German Apple Tart.</i>—One and three-quarter
pounds of apples, quarter of a pound
of dates.</p>

<p>Peel, core, and cut the apples into small
pieces, stone and quarter the dates, and put
them in a pan with a very little water and
stew till soft. Then stir in two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, one ounce of butter, one teaspoonful
of ground cinnamon, half a teaspoonful of
ginger. Beat smooth, then turn out to cool.</p>

<p>Make a short crust of half a pound of flour,
two ounces of castor sugar, one teaspoonful
of cinnamon, a small teaspoonful of baking
powder, and a quarter of a pound of butter.
Rub all together and work into a dough with
the yolk of one egg and half a teacup of milk.
Divide the dough into three pieces, roll out
for bottom and sides a little thicker than the
piece for the top. Line tin, fill up with the
apple mixture, smooth on top, then lay third
piece of crust over it, pinching the edge to the
side crust, then bake in a moderate oven for
half an hour. Beat the white of the egg to
a stiff froth, sift in two ounces of castor sugar,
a drop or two of lemon juice, and then spread
evenly on top of the tart when nearly cool,
and leave to set.</p>

<p><i>Apple Mould.</i>—One and a half pounds of
apples, pare, core, and cut in quarters, put in
a pan with half a pound of sugar and four
ounces of butter. Stew till soft, but keep the
pieces whole, lift them on to a sieve and let
the syrup run into a dish. Butter a pudding-dish,
line it with thin fingers of bread, lay in
the pieces of apple, cover with slices of bread,
brush over with egg, pour over some syrup,
and bake in a moderate oven for three-quarters
of an hour. Turn out and serve with sauce.</p>

<p><i>Apple Charlotte.</i>—One and a half pounds
of apples, peel, core, and cut up, and put on
to stew with very little water and three ounces
of sugar. When soft rub through a sieve,
then put back into the pan, add four ounces
more sugar and simmer till thick, taking care
not to let the pulp burn.</p>

<p>Cut some stale bread into fingers, dip into
melted butter, and arrange them round a well-buttered
pudding mould, lapping one edge
over the other and pressing firmly down, cover
the bottom with rounds of bread in the same
way, shake in some bread-crumbs, fill up with
the apples, place more rounds of bread on the
top, put into the oven and bake for an hour.
Turn on to a dish, let it stand a few minutes,
then draw off the mould and dust sugar over.
By allowing the mould to remain a little, there
is less danger of it sticking.</p>

<p>Before leaving the recipes for apples, I
would like to give an excellent way of stewing.
Pare the apples, quarter them, take out the
cores, and cut the quarters into thin slices,
then put them into a pan, put sugar over
them to taste, shake it down through the
fruit, then put a piece of white paper over,
tucking it well round the edges to keep in the
steam, then put on the lid, and set the pan at
the side of the fire and shake occasionally till
it heats.</p>

<p>The steam generated by the moisture of the
apples is quite enough to prevent burning, and
if care is taken in shaking the pan well there
is no fear of burning. Stew slowly till soft.
By using no water, the flavour of the fruit is
much finer and the apples become a clear jelly
and are most delicious to taste.</p>

<p><i>Gooseberry Fool.</i>—Take a quart of green
gooseberries, put them, after topping and
tailing them, into a pan with four ounces of
loaf sugar and stew them as directed for the
apples—without water. When soft, rub them
through a sieve, and then stir into the purée
half a pint of thick cream, stir all together,
add more sugar if required, then when cold
pour into a crystal dish. Garnish with whipped
cream on the top.</p>

<p><i>Gooseberry Pudding.</i>—One pint of nearly
ripe gooseberries, six slices of stale bread
toasted, one cupful of milk, half a cupful of
sugar, and one tablespoonful of melted butter.
Stew the gooseberries very slowly so as not
to break them. Cut your bread to fit your
pudding-dish, toast the pieces, then dip while
hot into the milk, then spread with butter,
and cover the bottom of the dish with some
of the pieces; put next a layer of the cooked
gooseberries, sprinkle with sugar, then put
more toast, more fruit and sugar, and so
on till the dish is full. Cover closely and
steam in a moderate oven for half an hour.
Turn out and pour a sauce over it or eat with
cream.</p>

<p><i>Gooseberry Flummery.</i>—Take six ounces of
rice and wash it, then put it into a pan with two
pints of milk, and let it cook slowly till it gets
soft and thick, then add two ounces of sugar
and stir well. Let it get cold, then butter or
oil a mould and cover the inside with a layer
of the rice about an inch thick, leaving the
inside empty till the rice sets. Then fill up
with gooseberries stewed thick and soft with
sugar and no water, and let it stand till quite
stiff and cold. Turn upside down carefully—just
before serving a little time—and draw off
the mould carefully so as not to break the
rice. This can also be steamed after putting
in the fruit and served hot with custard
sauce.</p>

<p><i>Flummery of Currants.</i>—Take two pints
of red currants, squeeze them and take the
juice, add a little raspberry juice, and add
three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar and
six ounces of rice flour to it; cook all over
the fire and stir continually. Boil for five
minutes, then pour into a mould which has
been dipped in cold water. Let it stand till
cold and set, then turn out.</p>

<p><i>Raspberry Mould.</i>—Have a mould—a plain
one—or a small bowl lined with strips of stale
bread, packing them closely together. Then
have some raspberries stewed with enough
sugar to sweeten them, pour into the mould,
cover the top over with fingers of bread, seeing
that the mould is quite full, put a plate or
saucer on the top with a weight on it and set
away till cold. Then turn out. This is all
the better for being made the day before it is
required so as to give it time to soak up all
the juice into the bread; then it is a pretty
pink shape. Any kind of fruit—juicy—can
be used in this way, but raspberries or red
currants are the nicest.</p>

<p><i>Lemon Pudding.</i>—Take two tablespoonfuls
of cornflour and wet it with a little cold water,
then add boiling water to make a thick starch,
add five spoonfuls of sugar, the juice and
grated rind of two lemons and the yolks of
two eggs well beaten. Pour into a dish and
bake for ten minutes, then heap the stiffly-beaten
whites on the top, dust with sugar
and brown very lightly in the oven for a few
minutes.</p>

<p><i>Compôte of Oranges.</i>—Pare the rind of
three large oranges, cut the fruit across into
halves, removing the pips and white skin and
pile the fruit in a glass dish. Boil the thin
rind with half a pint of water and six ounces of
loaf sugar, till the syrup is clear and thick,
then strain it over the fruit. Garnish with
little spoonfuls of whipped cream.</p>

<p><i>Pear Meringue.</i>—Take a dozen and a half
pears, peel them and put into a pan with
sugar and a very little water and stew till
tender, but avoid breaking them. Lift them
carefully and arrange them neatly in a glass
dish. Boil up the syrup with more sugar till
thickish, add a drop or two of cochineal—pear
syrup is always rather a dull colour
without it—and pour over the fruit. Take
the whites of three eggs and whip them very
stiff, add six spoonfuls of castor sugar, spread
roughly over the pears and brown slightly in
the oven or with a salamander.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb Cheesecake.</i>—Stew a bunch of
green rhubarb till soft, then beat it smooth
with a fork, draining nearly all the syrup away.
Add to the pulp the juice of two lemons,
grated rind of one, a scrape of nutmeg—if
liked—and sugar to taste, then add three
well-beaten eggs. Have a pie-dish lined with
pastry—or a deep plate will do—pour in the
mixture and bake in a moderate oven for three-quarters
of an hour. Serve cold.</p>

<p><i>Prune Pudding.</i>—Half a pound of prunes.
Stew till soft, then remove the stones and add
sugar to taste, then the whites of four eggs
beaten stiff, put into a dish and bake to a
pale brown.</p>

<p><i>Orange Fool.</i>—Juice of four sweet oranges,
three eggs well beaten, one pint of cream,
sugar to taste, and a very little cinnamon and
nutmeg.</p>

<p>Put all into a pan and set it on the fire
till the mixture is as thick as melted butter,
keep stirring, but do not let it boil, then when
a little cool pour into a glass dish. Serve
cold.</p>

<p><i>Queen’s Mould.</i>—Skin and cut into small
pieces enough young rhubarb to fill a quart
measure, put into an enamelled pan with one
and a quarter pounds of sugar, the grated rind
and juice of half a lemon, and twelve almonds
blanched and chopped; boil fast and skin and
stir till all is a rich marmalade, then add half
an ounce of gelatine dissolved in two tablespoonfuls
of boiling water. Rub a mould
with oil, pour in the rhubarb, and set aside
to cool and set. Turn out and serve with
cream.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb Scone Pudding.</i>—Make a plain
paste of half a pound of flour, two ounces of
butter, a dessertspoonful of castor sugar, a
pinch of salt, one teaspoonful of cream of
tartar, half a teaspoonful of baking soda.
Rub all together, then add enough sweet
milk to make a nice firm paste, roll out the
size of a dinner plate, butter the plate, lay the
paste on and ornament the edge, and bake in
a moderate oven till done. Fill the middle
with stewed rhubarb—any stewed fruit is
good—cover with the whites of two eggs
beaten stiff, dust the top thickly with castor
sugar and return to the oven to let it get a
pale brown.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> occurred to me some years ago that, out of
the five or six hundred trees and plants mentioned
in the Bible, the leaves of a large
proportion of them might easily be obtained,
dried and arranged in an album, and that such
a collection might be made of great use in
teaching Scripture, illustrating the meaning of
various texts and throwing a light on obscure
passages.</p>

<p>My album of Bible trees and plants is often
in request. I have found great pleasure in
collecting the various specimens, and am still
hoping to secure other trees to complete the
book.</p>

<p>At first one is apt to think that only
eastern travellers can obtain the requisite
leaves, but a little reading and Bible study
will convince us that very many Scripture
trees and plants are quite common and easily
obtainable by anyone living in the country.
I subjoin a list with which we may begin
our book.</p>

xvii. 6); myrtle (Is. lv. 13); nettle (Is. xxxiv.
13); oak (Gen. xxxv. 8); poplar (Gen. xxx.

<p>A perfect leaf or spray of each tree should
be laid between sheets of blotting-paper under
a heavy weight, the paper being dried daily
till the specimen is fit for insertion in the book.</p>

<p>The album may be of any shape we please,
but about twelve inches by ten is a convenient
size and shape for the purpose.</p>

<p>When the leaf is fixed upon the page the
Latin and English name should be written
beneath it and the Bible texts in which the
tree is mentioned.</p>

<p>I find strips of gummed paper hold the
leaves most securely, and instead of using
stamp paper, which is too thin for the purpose,
I cover a sheet of notepaper with thick gum
and allow it to become quite dry; it is then
ready for use and affords a large supply of
tiny strips.</p>

<p>Besides the texts I like to add all I can
learn as to the history and uses of the various
trees and plants.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, is what I have said about
the myrtle.</p>

<p>“A plant originally brought from Western
Asia but found wild as far as Afghanistan.</p>

<p>“Among the ancients the myrtle was sacred
to Venus; wreaths of it were worn by the
victors in the Olympic Games and by
Athenian magistrates. It was used in medicine,
in cookery, and by the Tuscans in the preparation
of myrtle wine, called Myrtidanum, for
which purpose it is still employed. It is,
however, chiefly used in perfumery, and a
highly-scented astringent water called Eau
d’Ange is distilled from its flowers. The
berries have a sweetish, powerfully aromatic
taste, and are eaten in a fresh state or dried as
a condiment.</p>

<p>“The wood is very hard and beautifully
veined.”</p>

<p>This account I compiled and wrote in my
album about twenty-six years ago; perhaps
at the present time many interesting facts
about the myrtle might be added.</p>

<p>I have as yet only spoken of the trees and
plants of easy attainment for our Scripture
album.</p>

<p>The more interesting specimens such as
carob-tree, olive, pomegranate, palm, oleander
and others we may have to wait for, but with
a little thought and patience we may probably
obtain even these.</p>

<p>If we happen to know any friends who are
going to the South of France for the winter,
they could easily dry some sprays of the
plants I have mentioned, and bring them to
us in due time. If we have not this possibility,
then in some florist’s greenhouse we may
probably meet with oleander and palm, and
we may grow our own carob-trees by sowing
the seeds in pots, and, sheltered indoors from
frosts, they will germinate and in time produce
leaves large enough for the album. The carob
is not mentioned by name in the Bible, but it
is a Palestine tree, and yields the long, brown
pods which were the “husks that the swine
did eat” in the parable of the Prodigal Son;
they are also believed to have been the
“locusts” which, combined with “wild honey,”
sustained John the Baptist in the wilderness,
hence they are often called St. John’s bread.
If we desire to buy the pods, they may be
obtained at most corn-dealers under the name
of “locusts.”</p>

<p>Another interesting fact about the carob is
this, that the brown hard seeds used to be the
weights jewellers employed for weighing gold,
silver, and precious stones; hence the term
“carat” with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>The long curved pods are eaten, when
fresh, by the poorer inhabitants of Palestine;
they are sweet and nourishing.</p>

<p>The oleander is not mentioned in the Bible,
but it grows so abundantly on the shores of
the Lake of Galilee that it has some claim to
be admitted into our collection.</p>

<p>We may grow our own date plants if we
will; the seeds germinate very freely at any
season if kept warm and in moist soil. The
leaf does not divide into leaflets and become
a true palm leaf until the plant is five or six
years old. If we desire a small palm leaf that
will at once fit into our book, any florist will
be able to supply a spray of <i>Cocos veitchii</i>, a
small and delicate species just fitted for the
purpose.</p>

<p>These hints will enable anyone to form a
Bible plant album, and many a pleasant and
profitable hour may be spent in reading about
each tree, and the passages in Scripture
where they are mentioned are invested with a
deeper interest from our knowledge of many
facts which otherwise would have passed
unnoticed.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">here</span> is Sheila,
Effie?”</p>

<p>“Gone for a ride
along the New
Road with Lady Dumaresq
and her brother,” answered
Effie with a slight
toss of the head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart looked annoyed.</p>

<p>“She had no business to go without
my permission.”</p>

<p>“Much Sheila cares for that!” snorted
Effie; but then with perhaps a better
impulse she added, “Well, you were
out, you know. And Lady Dumaresq
sent up to ask her, and they had ordered
a horse for her. I suppose she couldn’t
very well have refused. She seems to
belong more to them than to us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart’s ordinarily placid face
darkened; that was exactly her own
feeling, and she did not like it. The
Dumaresqs were undeniably the “best”
people at the hotel. The mother had arranged
to spend this winter in Madeira
partly that Effie might have the opportunity
of making friends on equal terms
with persons of a higher social standing
than were attainable at home. It had even
passed through her mind that Ronald
Dumaresq would be a good match for
her daughter. Hitherto she had never
thought of Effie’s leaving her, but something
the last doctor had said had put
the notion into her head.</p>

<p>“Take her away and throw her with
a lot of strangers. Let her mix with
other people and get fresh interests.
She has been too much shut up and
thrown upon herself. Her nerves want
bracing, and there is nothing like change
of scene and companionship for that.
You say she has never had a ‘disappointment,’
so much the better. She
may find the right man for a husband
one of these days, and in some respects
that would be the best thing possible.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Cossart, for the first time in
her life, was rather disposed to make
schemes for her daughter’s matrimonial
settlement.</p>

<p>“Didn’t they ask you too?” she
asked. “It would only have been
polite.”</p>

<p>Effie made her little defiant gesture
with head and shoulders.</p>

<p>“I don’t think grand people who are
thought so much of are very polite. I
suppose they think themselves too grand.
Besides, they know I don’t like the
horses here. But don’t you trouble
about me, mother. I am all right. I
don’t want a lot of strangers to run
after. I don’t care to make myself
cheap, like Sheila. I am quite happy
with my books and work up here, and
the garden to walk in. I never was one
for always gadding. I think it’s charming
to sit here in the sunshine and watch
the sea. I get tired of all the silly
babble that amuses Sheila. It’s more
interesting to think one’s own thoughts.
I have lots of thoughts. Perhaps I shall
write them down some day when I’m
stronger. I shouldn’t like to be always
hanging on to other people. I’m not
made like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am afraid Sheila is very
forward; I shall have to put a stop to
her goings on, I think. People are
beginning to talk about her. She was
brought to be a companion for you, and
she is always off with other people.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t think I want her,” cried
Effie, laughing. “I get quite enough of
her as it is, I assure you! We are good
enough friends, but Sheila has such a
shallow mind. I get tired of her. I
like to go deeper into things; but when
I talk she always either laughs or goes
rattling off about some tennis match or
cricket, or picnic. I can’t make things
like that the aim and object of my
existence.”</p>

<p>“But we want you to get out and see
people, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and so I do; and perhaps
there will be some more people by-and-by
whom I shall like better. But I
was rather glad to be rid of Sheila this
afternoon, as it happens; for the two
Miss Murchisons are coming to tea. I
always enjoy them most alone. We
like the same things, and Sheila doesn’t.
She spoils it by making nonsense of
everything.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart did not reply; she had
never opposed her daughter in any of
her plans, and did not like to begin
now; but as a matter of fact the two
Miss Murchisons were by no means the
companions she would have selected for
her. They were pleasant girls enough,
but their father was a tradesman in Leeds
in a good way of business; and though
everybody in the hotel was kind and
civil to them, they were not in the swim
in any sense of the word. One of the
pair was delicate, and perhaps that had
formed a bond. She could not play
tennis, or go down in the evening to
play in the billiard-room, or scramble
up the steep roads either on foot or on
horseback. Anyhow, Effie had taken a
fancy to these girls, and would have
them to her rooms, or go to theirs and
spend hours in talking. Mrs. Cossart
got an impression that they mutually
told each other every detail of their
respective illnesses, and all they had
gone through; and she was beginning
to understand that that sort of talk
was bad for Effie; yet having herself
encouraged it for so many years, she
found it very difficult either to break
herself of the habit or to break it in
Effie.</p>

<p>The guests, in fact, appeared almost
before there was time for more words,
and Effie visibly brightened. Mrs.
Cossart lingered awhile listening to the
talk; but presently she betook herself
to the garden to find her husband, who
was greatly enjoying the easy life in the
exquisite climate, where it was never
cold and seldom too hot, and where
he could sit out in sunshine or shade
with his paper and pipe from morning
to night, enjoying interludes of talk and
friendly gossip with other elderly gentlemen
of like tastes and habits.</p>

<p>They wandered about a little and
finally betook themselves to the level
garden outside the front door, and
before long there was a clatter of horse-hoofs,
and the riding party returned.
Sheila, as usual, was bubbling over with
fun, and her gay laugh rang out again
and again as she dismounted and came
along with Ronald in attendance.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, Lady Dumaresq,
it has been a delightful ride!” she cried,
turning back towards their companion
who was bringing up the rear more
slowly. “What dear, little, plucky
horses they are, though they do pull!
They do like to get off the cobbles on to
a proper road. And what a funny little
village that is at the end of the road!
Didn’t the people look wild and queer?”</p>

<p>“I believe they are rather a wild lot,”
answered Lady Dumaresq, smiling;
“but you must be thirsty, little girl.
Come with us and have some tea. Guy
and Aunt Mary are sure to have it all
ready for us.” Then seeing Mrs.
Cossart she added, with one of her
gracious smiles, “You will let us give
the baby her tea, will you not, since we
have ridden her so hard?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, you are very kind,”
answered Mrs. Cossart, rather stiffly,
for she never could get used to what she
called “grand people,” though she
longed to be friendly with them, and
was secretly pleased when Lady
Dumaresq spoke to her in presence of
other guests. But why was it Sheila<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">{638}</a></span>
whom these people had taken up,
making a pet and baby of her, and
encouraging her in all her little spoilt-child
ways? If it had only been Effie
now, the mother would have been brimming
over with delight; but Sheila was
quite spoiled enough as it was; it was a
thousand pities she should be made so
much of here.</p>

<p>Effie was able now to appear at
luncheon and dinner, and her mother
took care that she was always well
dressed and looked her best. Sir Guy
Dumaresq had the seat at the end of
the table farthest from the door; his
own party sat at his right hand, and the
Cossarts opposite at his left. Thus they
seemed in a fashion to make one party,
and conversation was usually more or
less general.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Cossart,” said Ronald to
Effie that day, “you’ve not done a single
thing since you came. We must really
rout you up. Let’s make up a party
and take the funicular railway to the
Mount Church to-morrow, and come
down in running carros. It’s the most
screaming fun, and perfectly safe. I
know Miss Sheila is just aching to go in
one; and you must come too!”</p>

<p>“There, Effie,” cried Mrs. Cossart,
beaming, “isn’t that a charming plan?”</p>

<p>Effie pursed up her lips and gave her
head a little toss.</p>

<p>“I don’t know till I’ve tried. I
thought it always rained up at the
Mount. I see the clouds come down
every day about noon. But I’ll come
if you want me; if I do get wet, I do.
I don’t care so very much. If I do get
a bad night afterwards it won’t kill me,
I daresay!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll take care of you!” cried
Ronald, laughing. “Guy is going; and
he isn’t to get wet either; so we’ll make
love to the clerk of the weather. But
the mornings are almost always fine
even up there. It’s in the afternoon the
clouds come down.”</p>

<p>Sheila was delighted to think of going
on this excursion. So far, although they
had now been several weeks in the
island, she had seen very little. The
Cossarts liked to take things quietly,
and there was plenty of time, they kept
saying, to see everything.</p>

<p>The few rides with Effie had not been
particularly exhilarating, as she had
been nervous and dissatisfied with the
horses, and though Ronald had gone
prospecting about, the Dumaresqs and
Miss Adene had been content for the
most part with the pleasures of the
garden; and so Sheila’s opportunities
for sight-seeing had been but few.</p>

<p>However, nothing could have been
more favourable than the weather the
next day. Fine as it almost always was
down in Funchal, there were days when
the hills and mountain peaks were
wrapped in cloud, and those who ventured
up their sides were speedily wet
through. But to-day all was clear and
bright and sunny; and as the little
railway train climbed puffing up the
steep track, the air seemed to grow
more and more clear and buoyant, and
Sheila laughed aloud from pure gladness
of heart.</p>

<p>All the Dumaresqs were of the party,
including little Guy, who clung close to
Sheila, and who was her especial care.
Miss Adene went with them, “to keep
them in bounds,” as she said, and Ronald
and Effie completed the party. Perhaps
Ronald felt he had rather neglected the
delicate girl, whose pleasures seemed
few and far between; for he constituted
himself her cavalier that day; gave her
his hand over any rough ground; pointed
out the various objects of interests, and
promised to be her companion in the
running carro for the descent.</p>

<p>The air felt fresh and almost cold when
they left the train. Sheila drank in
long breaths with keen delight.</p>

<p>“It is almost like being in England
again! I do love the lazy heat down
below; but it is delightful to get up
here where one feels like running and
jumping!” and forthwith she and little
Guy began chasing each other in and
out amongst the trees and zigzag paths,
till Miss Adene called to them that they
were going up to the church, and told
them to follow.</p>

<p>After they had seen the big bare
church with its curious images, they got
some very curious thick strong coffee at
the little hotel, and then Ronald went in
search of carros sufficient for all the
party.</p>

<p>“Miss Adene, you’ll go with me and
little Guy, won’t you?” said Sheila.
“I’ll hold him on my knee and take care
of him. You’ll trust him to me, won’t
you, Lady Dumaresq, and you can take
care of Sir Guy!”</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I be allowed to take care of
my own wife?” asked Sir Guy, laughing;
and Sheila laughed and blushed
and answered quaintly—</p>

<p>“I think you always do take care of
one another, Sir Guy.”</p>

<p>From the Mount Church a cobble-paved
road ran sheer down the steep
hillside into the town lying beneath.
The running carros were baskets on
runners, holding two persons, and managed
by two men, who held them back
and steered them by ropes, running
alongside or behind, and calling out to
all other passengers to get out of the
way. For the road was a public highway,
and bullocks dragging up loads on
sledges, or men, women, and children
with their market produce or purchases
on their heads, would be constantly
met or passed coming up or going
down.</p>

<p>The sensation of the running carro is
very strange at first. It glides off with
a gentle motion, gathering velocity as it
gets its momentum, till at last it seems
flying downwards in a perfectly irresponsible
way; and only the clever steering
and checking of the runners saves the
traveller from the feeling that he must
of necessity be flying to inevitable
destruction.</p>

<p>Sheila’s nerves were strong, and she
and little Guy laughed aloud as they
flew downwards; whilst Miss Adene
had had experience of these methods,
and took the descent quite calmly.</p>

<p>“I wonder how Effie likes it!” cried
Sheila in one of the pauses, where the
runners have to be greased, or the
basket-work might be in danger of charring,
so tremendous is the heat generated
by the friction.</p>

<p>Effie, however, seemed to have got on
well as they joined company at the
bottom of the slide, and found bullock
carros waiting to take them home. She
was more animated than usual, and declared
that she had not been frightened
at all after just the first; and Ronald
said she had stood it like a brick.</p>

<p>When they got home Mrs. Cossart
was eager to hear Effie’s story, and very
pleased at her pleasure in the day’s
outing.</p>

<p>“It is quite right and proper that you
should go with Sheila when they ask
her. You got on very well with them,
did you not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, very well indeed. Mr.
Dumaresq never noticed Sheila at all
when I was there. He is really very
intelligent. I enjoyed talking to him.
He has plenty of sense, though he has
such good spirits. I like him very
much.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart was well pleased. The
thought which had lately come into her
head seemed now to take firmer root.
Certainly a marriage into some really
good family would be an excellent thing
for Effie; and her handsome dowry ought
to be an inducement which no young
man would altogether overlook.</p>

<p>So the mother’s eyes were very
jealously on the watch the next days
and weeks; and often her heart swelled
within her with anger and jealous displeasure.
For it was impossible to
ignore the fact that Sheila was the
favourite. However well Effie was
dressed, however she was put forward
and “trotted out” by her mother, it
was Sheila’s merry laugh, Sheila’s saucy
or appealing speeches, Sheila’s big soft
eyes that seemed to win her way
everywhere.</p>

<p>“I wish I had never brought that
girl!” cried Mrs. Cossart one evening
in exasperation to her husband.</p>

<p>“What girl, my dear?” asked Mr.
Cossart mildly. “I thought it was doing
Effie so much good. She is another
creature.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Effie, if it were only her; but
there is Sheila! I am out of all patience
with her! I declare if there is a good
opportunity I will ship her back to England.
It is too bad the way she is going
on!”</p>

<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span>—The glands under your arm have inflamed
and broken down, and you ask us to tell you
what has caused this. There are many possible
causes, but we will confine our remarks to the
commonest, and therefore most likely causes. The
use of these glands is to filter off from the lymph
any impurities it may contain. Let us briefly glance
at physiological considerations to enable us to
understand why these glands are so extremely commonly
inflamed. Your right arm is affected. Very
well. The blood reaches your right arm and hand
by the arteries. Part of the blood returns to the
heart by the veins, part of it exudes through the
walls of the smallest arteries. This part is not red
but colourless, and is called lymph. This lymph
bathes and nourishes the tissues, giving them food,
and taking away with it their impurities. This
lymph flows back through colourless vessels called
lymph-channels, which end in the veins of the neck;
but we said that the lymph takes up impurities in
its passage. These impurities are partly physiological
and partly unhealthy; the latter consist of
germs. If these germs were sent into the blood-stream
there would be disastrous consequences,
and to prevent this the lymph-glands are placed in
the course of the lymph-channels just before these
enter the blood-stream. All the lymph is forced
through these glands as through a filter, and any
germs it may contain remain in the glands, and are
quickly destroyed by the elements of the glands,
which are there for this purpose. But suppose you
have an abscess on your hand; that abscess is
swarming with germs, and the lymph in its passage
will carry away a vast number of these injurious
microbes, and will take them to the glands of the
armpit. The germs remain in the glands and give
the glands extra work to do. The glands will
enlarge and become inflamed. If the infection of
the glands is very virulent, the glands may, as it
were, die at their post and become abscesses.
Now we can proceed. The commonest cause of
inflamed glands in the axilla is inflammation and
suppuration about the hand or arm. An abscess, a
small dirty wound, or anything of a septic character
on the arm or hand will produce inflammation
of the glands under the arm. In these cases, as
soon as the primary condition is remedied the
glands regain their normal condition. But suppose
that the primary wound was a stab in the hand
from a hat-pin, which in some way had become
infected with the germs of tubercle; then the glands
will also become infected with tubercle, and this
brings us to the second commonest form of inflammation
of lymphatic glands, the so-called strumous
or scrofulous glands. This is an exceedingly common
affection, especially in children. Good diet
and cod-liver oil will help to enable the body to
withstand this disease. Sea air, and especially the
air of Margate, Folkestone, or Cromer will do more
than anything else to cure this affection in its early
stages. Sometimes, in the later stages, or in cases
where the malady has been neglected, operation is
necessary to prevent excessive scarring or exhaustion
from continued discharge. It is imperative
when glands have broken down, and are discharging,
that they should be kept extremely clean and
free from external infections by the use of local
antiseptic washes and applications. The arm must
also be kept at rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Girton Girl.</span>—Should persons with organic disease
of the heart marry? is a question which is very
much easier to ask than it is to answer. In this
case we have not to consider the dangers of heredity,
for though heart-disease, and still more so,
the commonest cause of heart-disease, rheumatism,
is undoubtedly sometimes hereditary, it is not sufficiently
so to forbid marriage on this score. Our
personal experience is that heart-disease is not
hereditary. Nor is heart-disease an infectious
disease like consumption, which you could communicate
to your children or husband. Valvular
disease is so varied in its nature and degree that
it is impossible to lay down laws which are
applicable to every case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glasbury.</span>—Influenza is a terrible disease, and it
often leaves much suffering in its train. Indeed,
we know of no disease which leaves so much ill-health
behind it. You, it has left with dyspepsia
and nervous weakness—perhaps its commonest
legacy. You must be exceedingly careful of your
diet. The wind in your stomach you can relieve by
bicarbonate of soda or by two or three drops of
essence of ginger in a wineglassful of water. At
the present time you should feed as well as your
dyspepsia will admit; and, really, to treat indigestion
properly does not entail many privations.
Meat and malt wine, or cod-liver oil and maltine
would do you good if you can digest it; or you
might derive great benefit from a course of iron
with quinine or other bitter tonic. But you cannot
take the last until your indigestion is relieved.</p>

It is against our rules to give the name or address

<p><span class="smcap">Molly.</span>—Before attempting to cure any ailment, it is
necessary to discuss two questions. The first is—What
is the nature of the trouble? The second is—What
has caused it? It is only in certain cases
that one can answer both these questions definitely;
but the more clearly he answers these, the more
rational and efficacious will be the treatment of
the malady. And in the treatment itself, the first
thing to do is to remove the cause, if possible.
Now what causes your hands to get “hot and
clammy?” There is a possibility that it may be a
purely natural condition, for the palms of the
hands perspire more freely than any other part of
the body, and persons vary extremely in the
quantity of fluid which exudes through their skin.
Or your trouble may be due to some unhealthy
cause. Persons who are suffering from many forms
of illness perspire profusely. One of the commonest
causes is indigestion, which acts in this way. The
stomach lies just below the heart, and when the
stomach is in difficulty it worries the heart, and so
interferes with the circulation. This is the cause of
the flutterings, palpitations, flushes and excessive
perspirations, so common in indigestion. You must
therefore see to your digestion; also wash your
hands frequently in warm water with a good soap,
and occasionally rinse your hands in diluted toilet
vinegar. Do not wear kid gloves, but if you require
any gloves at all wear thin silk ones. Healthy
exercise is necessary in this as in every other
condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsa.</span>—This correspondent asks us the following
question. “My father and mother died of consumption,
and one of my sisters is in the last stages
of the same disease; am I going to get consumption?”
We are going to answer this question at
length because it gives us an opportunity for demonstrating
what is meant by hereditary influence in
disease; and also because here is a poor girl
worrying herself over a calamity which may never
occur. We say that consumption is an hereditary
disease, but this is not accurate. The disease is
not hereditary, but the tendency to it is. Consumption
is a chronic infectious disease caused by
the presence of the tubercle organism in the body.
It may and does strike down anybody; but those
who are sprung from a family with a tubercular
history are more liable to be attacked than others.
We have a great deal of evidence to show that
nearly one-tenth of the human race becomes infected
with tuberculosis, but only a very small
proportion of those infected succumb, or indeed
ever show symptoms of the disease. Now it is
presumable that those who do show symptoms have
some extra factor which prevents their throwing off
the disease. For instance, persons who suffer from
chronic bronchitis, or who are barrel-chested, or
who are run down in health, etc., are less likely to
successfully combat the disease than are others. It
is therefore one of these extra factors which is
hereditary; it may be a peculiarly-shaped chest, for
instance. Nobody is born with the tubercle germ
inside her. So if every relative of yours died of
consumption, you can prevent yourself from contracting
the disease by running away from the
tubercle germ and living in a spot where this worst
of all human pests does not exist. Unfortunately
this germ is almost ubiquitous. It swarms in every
city and town, and lurks by rivers and in sandy
wastes. It does not inhabit the ocean or the high
latitudes or the tops of mountains. The sea-coast
is much less impregnated with this germ than are
the inland parts. The germ apparently dislikes
the north wind, and is therefore comparatively uncommon
on our East coasts. Therefore, if you
have a special dread of consumption, live in a land
where the tubercle bacillus does not thrive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athena.</span>—Occasionally it is possible to restore the
original form to a nose which has been broken.
Where there is great lateral deformity, the question
of correcting the displacement is well worth considering.
In the minor grades of distortion of the
nose, due to old injuries, it is scarcely worth while
to have an operation done. In recent injury the
nose should always be “set” at once, for in this
case deformity can be almost always prevented.
But remember that, if you have had your nose
“set” after a recent injury, and still deformity
does occur, you must not lay the blame on the
surgeon. All operations on the nose or any other
part of the face should be done by a specialist, if
possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga Bertha.</span>—The probable cause of your trouble
is anæmia and nervous exhaustion. We cannot
enter at length into the treatment of this condition
as we have done so many times already. You had
better give up bicycling for a time till you feel
stronger again. Drinking large quantities of water
does dilute the blood, but only for a second or
two, for if more water than is necessary is drunk,
though it is absorbed into the blood it is thrown
out again immediately by the skin, the kidneys and
the lungs. Drinking large quantities of fluid with
meals is a potent cause of dyspepsia, for the
gastric juice cannot digest anything when it is too
much diluted. Perhaps you would derive benefit
from meat and malt wine, or maltine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Natator.</span>—There have been many explanations of
the cause of cramp while bathing, and it is not yet
definitely settled which, if any, of these is correct.
The most probable theory is that cramp is due to
over-distention and paralysis of the heart. According
to this hypothesis, the contact of the skin with
the cold water causes all the blood-vessels of the
skin to contract and so force the blood which was
contained in them into the internal vessels. As
more blood than usual will be thus thrown into
those vessels which are deeply situated, the blood
pressure will rise greatly. The heart has to overcome
this pressure before it can drive the blood
through the body. But if the pressure is exceedingly
high, the heart may be unable to overcome it—a
condition which means instantaneous death.
But there are two conditions in which cramp occurs
whilst bathing. In the first way, the instant the
bather enters the water she is struck down by
cramp, and if help is not instantly forthcoming
she dies in a few seconds. In the second case, the
bather is all right till she has been in the water
perhaps half an hour; she is then gradually seized
with cramp. Let us see if we can reconcile both
these conditions to our heart theory? The first is
obvious from the above. In the second case we must
presume that although the blood pressure is raised,
still the heart, being healthy and strong, can
overcome it. But after half an hour’s violent
exercise the heart begins to tire, and is now no
longer capable of working against the great
resistance. This form of cramp is therefore more
gradual than the first; but both forms are necessarily
fatal unless timely help is at hand. Most of
the other theories of cramp refer the condition to
temporary derangements of the nervous system,
but Broadbent, the greatest authority on the heart,
is much in favour of the theory we have just
enunciated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terror.</span>—A bunion is an inflammation of the joint
of the great toe. It is almost always due to the
pressure of an ill-fitting boot. In the normal foot
the great toe stands away from the other toes, and
so, if boots were made to resemble the foot, the
inner border would be either perfectly straight or
slightly curved towards the middle line of the body.
But cobblers have improved on Nature, and they
make boots in which the inner border meets the
outer border in a point. In consequence of this
absurdity, the great toe is forced towards the other
toes; its chief joint is partially dislocated and the
ball of the toe forms a projection on the inner side.
This ball is part of the joint, and so the side of the
boot actually presses upon the joint itself. This
the joint is unable to stand. A “bursa”—that is,
a sort of water-cushion—is developed above the
ball of the toe, and so protects the joint from
pressure. This is Nature’s method of preserving
the human foot from the ignorance and stupidity of
its owner. But although Nature is very cute in
her way, she is unable to cope with the owner of the
foot, whose stupidity gets the better of the struggle,
though her foot comes off very badly indeed.
Nature has provided the above-mentioned water-cushion,
but the boots are still tight and misshapen.
The “water-cushion” now becomes
inflamed, its edges get thickened, the joint underneath
the water-cushion shares in the inflammation
and becomes destroyed. This is a bunion. So,
after all, Nature does get the better of it. She says
she will not have joints distorted and pressed upon,
and she has got her way, only she has had to
destroy the joint altogether. The treatment of a
bunion depends upon the stage of the disease. In
the early stages merely wearing properly-shaped
boots will undo the mischief. At a later date, a
special boot with a special compartment for the
great toe must be worn. In the last stages, nothing
but a surgical operation—no less than cutting away
the joint—will give relief. We cannot too strongly
impress upon you the necessity of wearing rightly-shaped
boots which do not distort the great toe.
For a bunion is really a serious disease, and, moreover,
if its cause is not removed, it is a progressive
disease, and will leave you in the end either a
cripple for life or with the necessity of having
to submit to a surgical operation of moderate
severity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curious.</span>—Pepsin is obtained by scraping the stomach
of a pig or calf. It is the chief digestive agent
secreted by the gastric juice. Papain is a vegetable
production, having much the same action as pepsin,
but is not so likely to do harm when taken for
indigestion. Peptone is the name given to the
product of albumin (proteid) when completely
digested. You will find an account of the digestion
in any book on physiology.</p>

enclose is “only sixteen and has had a poor education,”
her attempt does her credit. There are
many defects in composition; for instance, in
verse 5 the second person singular (thy) is interchanged
with the plural (you). The emphasis on
the second syllable of “cannot” (verse 1, line 2),
is quite inadmissible, and we think a word must
be omitted after “usual,” as that is not a substantive.—2.
Your writing strikes us as very good;
clear and legible, and likely, as you are only fifteen,
to become more “formed” with practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green-belle.</span>—We cannot say that you should encourage
your “little friend.” The verses you

quite young, she should choose a different sort
of theme when she wishes to attempt metrical
composition.</p>

<p>S. M.—Life is long, and we cannot decree that you
would never write well enough for publication; yet
it would be unkind on our part to encourage you in
any hope that we should be likely to publish your
efforts. The little story in rhyme you enclose is
pathetic, but many of the lines are halting. “And
who” (line 23) is an ungrammatical expression
where it stands. The composition of poetry that
will find acceptance is no easy task, so you must
not feel hurt by our criticism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pretty article here illustrated is no
sooner seen than coveted by most of the fair
sex, either for their own use or as a tiny
present for a friend. White satin of good
quality is used for the front of the bag, which
is further adorned with a delicate spray of
ribbon embroidery arranged in the form of a
slightly oblong wreath lightly outlined, around
which diminutive flowers and leaves are
placed. Pale blue, yellow, or green pongee
silk is suitable for the back of bag, which
is added when the embroidery has been
completed, previous to being filled with
wadding containing scent powder, and being
closed with strings of the delicate ribbon used
for the embroidery.</p>

<p><i>Materials required.</i>—White satin, pongee
silk, each four inches wide and six inches
long, three layers of wadding same size, pot
pourri or other scent powder, half a yard
each of cornflour blue, yellow and leaf-green
ribbon, such as is used for ribbon embroidery.
A thread of green filoselle is used for the tiny
stems and to outline the wreath, which should
be worked first.</p>

<p>The design consists of this
wreath and two groups of
flowers interspersed with
green leaves and coloured
buds. A pleasing variety
may be produced by using
green chenille instead of
ribbon for some of the leaves.
If any reader should find
difficulty in copying this
particular design, she may
substitute any small spray
and work it in any kind of
embroidery which she finds
easier and thinks suitable.
The effect of the whole
chiefly depends upon delicacy
of colour, design and
workmanship of whatever
kind introduced, and the
idea affords scope for endless
individual taste and
variety.</p>

<p>The ornamentation
should not extend more
than two inches from the
lower edge of the satin, so
as to escape the gatherings
by which the bag is closed
at the top. The simplest
way to carry out our design
is to copy the wreath’s outline
upon the satin with a
lead pencil and to work in
the flowers and leaves afterwards
from the illustration.
It is really quite easy to
do so in the case of such
a tiny spray, and first attempts may be made
by drawing it on paper until satisfied that the
arrangement has been satisfactorily copied.
After that the attempt should be made upon
the satin with or without pencil tracing,
according the worker’s ability.</p>

<p><i>To work rosette flower.</i>—Take four inches
of yellow ribbon, a single thread of fine
sewing silk or cotton, a common fine sewing
needle, and a large-eyed ribbon or crewel
needle. Draw or imagine a circle the size
of a small glove button. With the large-eyed
needle draw one end of ribbon through
the edge of circle. Take second needle and
thread, sew the end in place with one tiny
stitch and gather along one edge of ribbon,
which should be on right side of satin.
Then draw second end of ribbon through
to wrong side and draw in the gathering
thread very tightly to form a rosette as small
as possible. Stitch the centre in place,
taking the stitches through the extreme
edge of gathers only. Fasten off on wrong
side.</p>

<p>To work star, flowers and leaves but few
directions are required. Work with large-eyed
needle and a short length of ribbon. Draw
ribbon through to right side of satin, leaving
a short end at wrong side. Lay a bodkin
or other flat instrument in front of ribbon;
work one stitch over the bodkin and draw
it away. Work three more stitches in the
same way and finish centre with a large
French knot worked with silk or filoselle.
The foliage leaves are formed like the star
flower petals. The bodkin is used to keep
the ribbon flat and untwisted and from being
drawn too tightly. It is advisable to fasten
off the ends of ribbon on wrong side with
needle and thread after each length of ribbon
is worked up.</p>

<p>The reeds, which are most effective, consist
of a nicely-worked French knot, made of
coloured ribbon, on the top of a tiny green
stem. These knots may be worked in the usual
way, but some workers prefer to make a tied
single knot with an inch of ribbon by hand,
and then to draw each end through the work
with the large-eyed needle.</p>

<p>When the embroidery is completed, lay the
satin and silk together to make up the bag,
having right side of embroidery inside. Turn
down two inches of silk and satin together at
the top of bag. Keeping them in this position,
run the edges together along sides and
bottom. Raise the upper layer of turned-down
top and turn it over on opposite side,
and you will be pleased to find a neatly-finished
hem ready made, as it were, without
any further trouble. Next turn the work
right side out, lay some scent powder between
the layers of wadding, fold them in half crosswise
and slip all together into the bag. Next
take twelve inches of green, blue, and yellow
ribbon, and tie them round the bag about one
inch from the top, having first arranged the
back and front into artistic folds, if possible,
without the assistance of gathering threads,
which somewhat detract from the desired
effect of immaculate freshness indispensable to
work of the highest order.</p>

<p>Last of all, in the centre of embroidered
front form a smart, crisply-made bow, using
the three ribbons together so as to produce
a soft bunch of loops and ends bristling out at
each side.</p>

<p>Nothing then remains to be done save to
admire the pleasing result of your labour,
which, unless I am much mistaken, will
greatly exceed your expectations.</p>

<p>There is one more hint I cannot resist giving
you. It is this, three-sixteenths of a yard of
satin is a small amount and only costs a little
money, but it will make ten such scent-bags.
What a happy idea for those of you who
work for charity, and make their own little
birthday gifts! Won’t you try it?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
